# prisma-project

## progress checklist:
 1. [x] Creating a minimal typescript project, parsing a simple example datamodel with graphql.js into an AST and creating an internal data structure to represent models and their relationships
 2. [ ] Generate a schema with the top-level single object types (for `User` that would be `query.user` without any args and just the scalar fields.
 3. [ ] Add support for list scalar fields, both nullable and nonnullable fields
 4. [ ] Add relation fields
 5. [ ] Add the top level list fields (for `User` â†’ `query.users`)
 6. [ ] Add simple scalar arguments (like `first` and `skip`)
 7. [ ] Add all arguments to the queries
 8. [ ] Add all mutations
 9. [ ] Add all subscriptions
